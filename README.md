GOAL: A multi-platform Unity/C# turn-based strategy/tactics game.

Desired Features:
- Built on Unity with C#.
- Playable on mobile devices as well as PCs. (I.e. interface amenable to touch.)
- Stlylistic global map split into irregularly-shaped provinces.
- Simple yet deep strategic resource and province management.
- Easy-to-learn but hard-to-master tactical combat with competent AI.
