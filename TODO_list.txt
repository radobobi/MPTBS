GOALS:
- Create stylistic map broken into irregularly-shaped "provinces".
	- Style can be realistic or hand-drawn or whatever; 
	but should be distinct.
- Clean, extensible codebase that takes advantage of Unity features.

TODO:
- Add "units" and a mechanic for moving the units around the map.
	- Add pathfinding.
- Draw boundaries of cells. (Change shader.)
- Think of way to place terrain/worldmap under cells.
	- The end-goal is a highly stylistic underlying map.
- Consider placing rivers/mountains/etc on edges.
- Twist Voronoi cell boundaries. (Make them less straight and flat.)
	- Consider other ways of making "provinces" look less artificial.
	(On the other hand, many US states have straight borders.)

DONE:
- Create map split into Voronoi cells.
